The general form of the .lnt model file format follows. It's missing some
functionality (namely material), but that'll be added in later.

[4 bytes for number of groups (nog)]
[nog * 4 bytes for number of faces in each group (nof)]
[nog * nof * 4 bytes for number of triads on each face]
[4 bytes for number of vps]
[4 bytes for number of vts]
[4 bytes for number of vns]
[vps * 4 * 4 bytes for each position vertex]
[vts * 3 * 4 bytes for each texture vertex]
[vns * 3 * 4 bytes for each normal vertex]
[nog * nof * not * 3 * 4 bytes for each triad index]
